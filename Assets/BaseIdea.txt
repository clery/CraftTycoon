Blacksmith project

Your goal is to create the best weapons in the country.

You start with some gold and materials and basic smithing plans.

When you craft something, it has a quality. The more you specialize in a weapon type, the better the quality will be.

If the quality is superior to green, you can name the object.

You choose which and how much materials you want to use.

The better the materials, the better the weapon will be.

The quality is influenced by time investment and exp

The sell is by auction. When your weapon is finnished, it is to be sold. Then, it will be sold on a random value based on your renoun, quality of the craft and its strength.
